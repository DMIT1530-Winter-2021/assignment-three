# Assignment 3

## Introduction

Assignment 3 is a two-page, fully responsive build with a sticky header, horizontal scrolling content, a parallax scroll background, and semantic forms. 

All SVG images are provided in the assets folder. The student is required to obtain the other images, color values, fonts, and measurements from the PSD. The completed site must demonstrate well-formed and structured HTML markup while writing clear and efficient CSS. The layout and styles will best match the PSD and adjust to different screen sizes using fluid and fixed layout techniques, and media queries. CSS properties used should have high global browser support (Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc.) and the site will need to properly display on all screen widths starting at 320px wide.

## Instructions

Following the steps of a build methodology:

1.	Using your own choice of a CSS reset, and a standard framework folder, start by defining and marking up the content for the home page. Check the logic, and the hierarchy of the document structure in the HTML5 outliner tool. Other than nav elements, there should be no untitled sections. Create the HTML file for the second page, “How it Works”, and copy and paste both the header and footer content into the new page. Ensure that the pages can link to each other. Add the HTML markup for the second page.

2.	Markup all form elements semantically and using the most appropriate input types and attributes. Form elements should be accessible with linked labels and inputs. Use attributes such as disabled, autofocus, name, autocomplete, placeholder, required, minlength, and maxlength logically and where necessary. 

3.	Once both pages have been semantically marked-up, outline checked, and validated for errors, the student will add the necessary CSS styling required to best match the look and layout of the PSD.
